"Not a Trump fan, but actually no, go listen to it, he simply wanted them to go out and at least vote this time, just so he can get into office for the next 4 years.  He is arrogant and selfish and only cares about being president again.  He rambled on for a few minutes, spoke about the NRA not voting and Christians not voting.  Why do people even comment before the listen for themselves?",The spin on this one is honestly pretty easy to predict. The claim will be that Trump meant that Trump'll do such a great job at fixing the country in the next four years that no one would ever vote for a Democratic candidate again.

"You're giving him way too much credit. There is not much in the context of the full quote to say insisting they get over it a day later isn't a completely awful thing to say. Regardless of whether he meant ""quit crying and get over it"" or ""there's nothing we can do but move on"" both of those things are truly awful things to say a day after a shooting to the community members affected by that shooting. There's a reason the timeline was given. It's important to the context as well.I am not pretending not to understand. I'm just not looking for ways to inject meaning into a quote as a way to soften a harsh, heartless message. Again, that's the message sent with both interpretations of ""get over it"" in this context. Can we not also bring in the context of the times? I.e. he and the conservatives are trying to downplay school shootings as much as possible. ""Let me acknowledge for one day that it's sad, but there's nothing we can do, and we should move on."" That would lend itself well to the minimization of a tragedy that conflicts with their message, no? We don't owe Donald Trump or conservatives any benefit of a doubt.

"I for one like that she's not Trump. I like that a lot to be honest. But there's other reasons as well such as:I like that she has more than 4 years of public service background. I like that even without an official place to look at her policies, she has 4 years of voting records documented from when she was a senator that shows more than just what she *says* her policy will be as well as over two decades of other public servant records. I like that rather than having a multitude of serious formal charges and 2 impeachments, she use to prosecute charges. I like that she doesn't publicly claim to be a billionaire that somehow represents the working class. I like that she's released 20 years of her tax returns to prove that she isn't a billionaire, contrary to Trump promising to release his and then not doing so which furthers the point that whatever he *says* his policy is cannot be trusted. I like that she hasn't told extremists to ""stand back and stand by"". I like that she has no possible ties to attempted insurrection. I like that her motives for running for President could not possibly include skirting charges/convictions against her. I like that she doesn't have a history of nepotism. I like that former Presidents have publicly endorsed her. I like that quite a few staff from former *Republican* Presidents have endorsed her. I like that she won't be an octogenarian while President. I like that she's worked side by side with a President before beginning President rather than President being her first political experience. I like that that means she has experience in dealing with politicians. And I really really like that she hasn't publicly referred to American citizens as ""vermin"" no matter how much she disagrees with them.I could go on but hopefully you get my point. If you want to know Harris' policies she has a well documented public servant record. Beyond that, Trump's extreme multitude of character flaws make him entirely unfit for President in my opinion and his very short documented public servant record (1 term as President) doesn't do enough to change my mind.","What do you like about Kamala?

"I've kinda looked into their gameplan.  They want to control so much about how people think, make decisions, and enjoy life. They want to leverage people's lives and diminish it to simply survival levels. Privatization of almost everything is a big part of it, including ""education"". They will watch the weak die (working class, not wealthy, not powerful) for their own profit and say it was God's will.Excuse the copy/paste from another conversation---I think the issue can be made in more simplistic terms. Trump represents the Christian Nationalist agenda. That's the base for the Project 2025 plan. It will inject their skewed beliefs of Christianity into every aspect of society. That's why their agenda seems all over the place.They will also take away every assistance program, subsidy (like for farmers) and safety net for the working class. This can include everything from Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, worker's comp, unemployment insurance, public education (notice the elimination of child labor limits), national parks, affordable housing, veteran's benefits, and the list goes on. These are programs and institutions that benefit everyone across the political spectrum. But yet, they want to eliminate or severely hamstring these programs.Now the why? Wealth distribution. The benefits from the elimination or limited spending on these programs will go straight to 1) Corporations and large businesses 2) the wealthy and large investors 3) politicians, lobbyists, and special interest groupsTLDR: The Christian Nationalist agenda calls for control over society. It also eliminates programs and institutions that benefit the working class. The savings from those programs won't go back to the people.

"@@ana-up2ss Let's be clear on something, Trump tried to close international travel from China when Covid first was announced. People called him a xenophobe and racist for doing so and refused to do that. Second, if Putin and Trump are ""pals"", then why didn't Putin attack Ukraine during Trump's presidency? Wouldn't you attack if you were Putin and thought Trump was your friend? Common sense, you clearly have none. Lastly back to the Covid comments, a vaccine came out in less than a year while Trump was president. It was made available in January as Biden got sworn into office and he tried to take credit for it. If Trump didn't take Covid seriously, he certainly could have fooled me. I am more interested in actions and what actually happened versus media bs. Every single thing that I mentioned happened.

President  Trump. It was an attack on you. What Harris did was unbelievable.  Never said what her policies were all she did was attack you like the kangaroo court did to you. Yes I read on the news that imagrients were eating ducks from a pond. You did great she was waiting to get under you skin to work you up. By her facial expressions when asked questions that she didn't know showed it all. Proud to be American.  Believe in one god whatever religion in a land of freedom liberty and justice.

"He WILL attend the debate. He can't afford not to. When he backed out, #trumpisacoward started trending on Truth Social, his own social media platform. His own supporters were so mad about him backing out of the debate that he finally caved and agreed to do it.If he backs out again, MAGA will be absolutely livid with him. If he's so tough and has such strong policies and is such a good orator and debater, then he should have no problem holding his own against a woman whom he calls a crazy radical communist. It's funny because whether he shows up or not, he's fucked. If he doesn't show up, that will be the informal end of his campaign. He might as well formally drop out at that point. If he does show up, it will be such a humiliating experience for him when Kamala wipes the floor with his stupid ass that, again, he might as well drop out of the race. It's a lose/lose for him. But he will lose fewer voters if he at least shows up.","I'm really hoping we get a debate between Harris and Trump.

"From Nate Silver:_Tim Walz is a Minnesota Nice choice_Wikipedia defines ""Minnesota Nice"" — the property stereotypically associated with the home state of Kamala Harris's new running mate, Gov. Tim Walz — as follows:Minnesota nice is a cultural stereotype applied to the behavior of people from Minnesota, implying residents are unusually courteous, reserved, and mild-mannered compared to people from other states and more akin to their Canadian neighbors in Northern Ontario. The phrase also implies polite friendliness, an aversion to open confrontation, a tendency toward understatement, a disinclination to make a direct fuss or stand out, apparent emotional restraint, and self-deprecation. It is sometimes associated with passive-aggression.Playwright and corporate communications consultant Syl Jones suggested that Minnesota nice is not so much about being ""nice"" but is more about keeping up appearances, maintaining the social order, and keeping people (including non-natives of the state) in their place.This was a choice designed to maintain the social fabric of the Democratic Party, and avoid news cycles about a disappointed left and Democrats' internal squabbling over the War in Gaza. Or at least, that's what I think it was: we'll need to learn more about Harris's deliberation process. I'm not inclined to be too deferential to any political candidate, but it's plausible that there were vetting issues with the runner-up, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Harris certainly has more information about the internal feeling within the Democratic caucus than I do, or she may just have thought the chemistry of a Harris-Shapiro ticket wouldn't work.It's a nice pick: Walz, a two-term governor and six-term U.S. Representative, is from the family of Tim Kaine-style VP choices: inoffensive, unlikely to cause any harm, ""safe"". Although maybe that's unfair: Walz is likely to be better on the stump than Kaine. If you surveyed Democratic members of Congress, he'd probably be who they'd choose. But I believe he's probably the wrong choice, a step back toward the Democratic Party's instincts to triangulate instead of the boldness the Harris campaign has displayed so far.I have a busy day ahead — the book publicity people have me busy, and later today I'm going to attempt to set a World Record by appearing on four consecutive podcasts in four hours (it's not an Olympic sport yet, alas) — so let's see if we can't get through this quickly.Do I think this is the right pick? No. On Saturday, I made the case that Harris should pick Shapiro. And nothing has really changed since then — although you could argue that Harris's increasingly strong position in the polls compels greater risk-aversion than when she'd initially appeared to be an underdog against Donald Trump. The basic reasons for picking Shapiro are that he increases the likelihood you win Pennsylvania, he has a demonstrated track record of popularity in the most important swing state, he's obviously an extremely talented politician and perhaps a future standard-bearer for the party himself. And also, the reasons for not picking Shapiro aren't great. Democrats in the political bubble overstate the salience of the Gaza issue and understate the benefits of moderation, and that's before getting into the issue of Shapiro's Jewishness.Is Walz a reasonable pick in a vacuum? Sure. He's not JD Vance. He's well-qualified. Personally, I find his schtick kind of charming, although you might expect me to say that as a fellow Midwesterner. And not unimportantly, he's not particularly left-wing himself and will likely read as being pretty moderate to voters, having a fairly centrist track record as a member of Congress. He might have been my second choice among Harris's finalists, although I think it was a real mistake not to consider Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who would seem to be a dominant strategy over Walz other than that it would mean having two women on the ticket.Do the margins of error overlap? Sure. Could this have been the right choice given reasonable uncertainties about the direction of the campaign? Sure. There's a lot we don't know. All of this veepstakes stuff is speculative — other than home-state effects, which are meaningful at the margin but not that large. In chess terms, I'd call it an inaccuracy — but not an outright blunder.Do I buy the Walzpilled arguments? In other words, do I think Walz has unique strengths of his own, perhaps even helping Harris elsewhere in the vote-rich Midwest? Mostly not, though maybe to some degree. It's an interesting biography — former U.S. Army officer, former schoolteacher. And although Walz's margins of victory as governor are nothing particularly impressive, his track record in a rural, increasingly Trumpy Congressional District were pretty good.But Minnesota is very unlikely to be the tipping point state — less than a 1 percent chance. It's not necessarily that Trump can't win it, but that if he does, it means that he's almost certainly already won states like Wisconsin and Michigan, with which Minnesota's electoral outcomes are strong correlated — and if he's already won those states, that means he's already at 270+ electoral votes. And some of Minnesota's mannerisms — like ""Minnesota Nice"" — are a bit peculiar and may not translate well outside of the state. It's a small thing, but Democrats from Minnesota (Humphery, Mondale and arguably Amy Klobuchar's primary campaign in 2020) do not have a great track record on the national stage.The chance each contest will decide the 2024 presidential election, the Voter Power Index in each contest, and the chance Harris or Trump will win a majority of electoral votes if they win each contest. States are colored based on their expected winnerDo I trust the process here? In other words, do I think Harris came to this choice for the right reasons — or at least the reasons that I think are the right reasons? Mostly not, I suppose, although as I said above, I'll want to read more reporting on the reasons for her pick. I certainly trust anything and everything involving the Harris campaign much more than I trusted anything that Biden was doing. But I thought the decision not to consider Whitmer or other candidates who weren't white men was poor and in some ways ironically harkened back to the process by which Harris herself was chosen.And I thought the rollout was a bit weird, creating some sense that Shapiro was left at the altar. With that said, I'm not seeing a ton of disappointment on Twitter — mostly just from strategy-minded, EV-maximizing folks like me — and maybe that was part of the problem for Shapiro. I'm not sure that he and his team played their cards well, allowing what were some pretty minor controversies to fester, and not securing the sort of vocal support that Walz did.",Megathread: Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Her 2024 Running Mate,lgrxy4p,,2024-08-06,1,1elhbeb,Megathread: Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Her 2024 Running Mate,2024-08-06,-1,Reddit,"If you surveyed Democratic members of Congress, Kamala Harris's new running mate, Gov.",Tim Walz — is likely to be better on the stump than Kaine.,12,0,1,1,[1 0 1],kamala,0,"entity of interest: kamala [SEP] If you surveyed Democratic members of Congress, Kamala Harris's new running mate, Gov.","[0.015085984952747822, 0.03650766983628273, 0.22621412575244904, 0.022419482469558716, 0.03413036838173866, 0.025263428688049316, 0.04310597479343414, 0.017769915983080864, 0.055664677172899246, 0.08286987245082855, 0.059859056025743484, 0.017367947846651077, 0.15831336379051208]",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],['others'],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",['voter sentiment'],voter sentiment,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",12,1,0.7807633280754089,"(1, 0.7807633280754089)","entity of interest: kamala [SEP] aspect of interest: voter sentiment [SEP] If you surveyed Democratic members of Congress, Kamala Harris's new running mate, Gov.",0,-0.2992778718471527,0

It is sometimes associated with passive-aggression.Playwright and corporate communications consultant Syl Jones suggested that Minnesota nice is not so much about being ""nice"" but is more about keeping up appearances, maintaining the social order, and keeping people (including non-natives of the state) in their place.This was a choice designed to maintain the social fabric of the Democratic Party, and avoid news cycles about a disappointed left and Democrats' internal squabbling over the War in Gaza. Or at least, that's what I think it was: we'll need to learn more about Harris's deliberation process. I'm not inclined to be too deferential to any political candidate, but it's plausible that there were vetting issues with the runner-up, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Harris certainly has more information about the internal feeling within the Democratic caucus than I do, or she may just have thought the chemistry of a Harris-Shapiro ticket wouldn't work.It's a nice pick: Walz, a two-term governor and six-term U.S. Representative, is from the family of Tim Kaine-style VP choices: inoffensive, unlikely to cause any harm, ""safe"". Although maybe that's unfair: Walz is likely to be better on the stump than Kaine. If you surveyed Democratic members of Congress, he'd probably be who they'd choose. But I believe he's probably the wrong choice, a step back toward the Democratic Party's instincts to triangulate instead of the boldness the Harris campaign has displayed so far.I have a busy day ahead — the book publicity people have me busy, and later today I'm going to attempt to set a World Record by appearing on four consecutive podcasts in four hours (it's not an Olympic sport yet, alas) — so let's see if we can't get through this quickly.Do I think this is the right pick? No. On Saturday, I made the case that Harris should pick Shapiro. And nothing has really changed since then — although you could argue that Harris's increasingly strong position in the polls compels greater risk-aversion than when she'd initially appeared to be an underdog against Donald Trump. The basic reasons for picking Shapiro are that he increases the likelihood you win Pennsylvania, he has a demonstrated track record of popularity in the most important swing state, he's obviously an extremely talented politician and perhaps a future standard-bearer for the party himself. And also, the reasons for not picking Shapiro aren't great. Democrats in the political bubble overstate the salience of the Gaza issue and understate the benefits of moderation, and that's before getting into the issue of Shapiro's Jewishness.Is Walz a reasonable pick in a vacuum? Sure. He's not JD Vance. He's well-qualified. Personally, I find his schtick kind of charming, although you might expect me to say that as a fellow Midwesterner. And not unimportantly, he's not particularly left-wing himself and will likely read as being pretty moderate to voters, having a fairly centrist track record as a member of Congress. He might have been my second choice among Harris's finalists, although I think it was a real mistake not to consider Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who would seem to be a dominant strategy over Walz other than that it would mean having two women on the ticket.Do the margins of error overlap? Sure. Could this have been the right choice given reasonable uncertainties about the direction of the campaign? Sure. There's a lot we don't know. All of this veepstakes stuff is speculative — other than home-state effects, which are meaningful at the margin but not that large. In chess terms, I'd call it an inaccuracy — but not an outright blunder.Do I buy the Walzpilled arguments? In other words, do I think Walz has unique strengths of his own, perhaps even helping Harris elsewhere in the vote-rich Midwest? Mostly not, though maybe to some degree. It's an interesting biography — former U.S. Army officer, former schoolteacher. And although Walz's margins of victory as governor are nothing particularly impressive, his track record in a rural, increasingly Trumpy Congressional District were pretty good.But Minnesota is very unlikely to be the tipping point state — less than a 1 percent chance. It's not necessarily that Trump can't win it, but that if he does, it means that he's almost certainly already won states like Wisconsin and Michigan, with which Minnesota's electoral outcomes are strong correlated — and if he's already won those states, that means he's already at 270+ electoral votes. And some of Minnesota's mannerisms — like ""Minnesota Nice"" — are a bit peculiar and may not translate well outside of the state. It's a small thing, but Democrats from Minnesota (Humphery, Mondale and arguably Amy Klobuchar's primary campaign in 2020) do not have a great track record on the national stage.The chance each contest will decide the 2024 presidential election, the Voter Power Index in each contest, and the chance Harris or Trump will win a majority of electoral votes if they win each contest. States are colored based on their expected winnerDo I trust the process here? In other words, do I think Harris came to this choice for the right reasons — or at least the reasons that I think are the right reasons? Mostly not, I suppose, although as I said above, I'll want to read more reporting on the reasons for her pick. I certainly trust anything and everything involving the Harris campaign much more than I trusted anything that Biden was doing. But I thought the decision not to consider Whitmer or other candidates who weren't white men was poor and in some ways ironically harkened back to the process by which Harris herself was chosen.And I thought the rollout was a bit weird, creating some sense that Shapiro was left at the altar. With that said, I'm not seeing a ton of disappointment on Twitter — mostly just from strategy-minded, EV-maximizing folks like me — and maybe that was part of the problem for Shapiro. I'm not sure that he and his team played their cards well, allowing what were some pretty minor controversies to fester, and not securing the sort of vocal support that Walz did.",Megathread: Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Her 2024 Running Mate,lgrxy4p,,2024-08-06,1,1elhbeb,Megathread: Vice President Kamala Harris Announces Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Her 2024 Running Mate,2024-08-06,-1,Reddit,"If you surveyed Democratic members of Congress, Kamala Harris's new running mate, Gov.",Tim Walz — is likely to be better on the stump than Kaine.,12,0,1,1,[1 0 1],others,2,"entity of interest: neither trump nor kamala [SEP] If you surveyed Democratic members of Congress, Kamala Harris's new running mate, Gov.","[0.01431170292198658, 0.037192050367593765, 0.22587740421295166, 0.021924464032053947, 0.03405529260635376, 0.02518538571894169, 0.04224216938018799, 0.017509007826447487, 0.05289864540100098, 0.07990469038486481, 0.05897804722189903, 0.01710592769086361, 0.15870974957942963]",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],['others'],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",['others'],others,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",13,0,0.8872135877609253,"(0, 0.8872135877609253)","entity of interest: neither trump nor kamala [SEP] aspect of interest: others [SEP] If you surveyed Democratic members of Congress, Kamala Harris's new running mate, Gov.",0,-0.2633388638496399,0

Verse 11 unequivocally tells people not to mingle with a man like Trump, and 12-13 completely disintegrates the fundamental base of conservatism- hating people who are different from them.","If you want arguments/bible verses for your Christian relatives you can also use matthew 7:12/luke 6:31: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you""Which is one of the two rules that Jesus gives and is the core principle around which Christianity revolves.This is a great verse to use when talking about LGBT or refugees/immigrants. Especially when talking about LGBT since this verse trumps every homophobic thing the Bible says. Make them think about how they would want to be treated if they were in that position. This is not going to change their opinion on lgbt itself, but it can change how they treat those people. Also asking them what Jesus would do in certain situations is a good one. When talking about immigrants and refugees you can refer to matthew 25:40: 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'The next ones (Deuteronomy 22.6 and 20:19) are about environmentalism: ""If you come across a bird's nest in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs and the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young.""""When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it in order to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them. You may eat from them, but you shall not cut them down. Are the trees in the field human, that they should be besieged by you?""Since things like pollution and climate change weren't a thing during the time the bible was written there are very few verses on environmentalism, but what you can say is that the earth doesn't belong to man but to God. He entrusted us with its care, we are its stewards. And 1 Corinthians 4:2 says: ""Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.""When it comes to abortion I'm afraid there are no bible verses that can be interpreted as being in favour of it.Hope these help!",lfhion7,lfha7yp,2024-07-29,5,1eesd8n,Trump’s Vice President says Trump should never be president again.,2024-07-29,5,Reddit,"Verse 11 unequivocally tells people not to mingle with a man like Trump, and 12-13 completely disintegrates the fundamental base of conservatism- hating people who are different from them.",(1 Corinthians 5:11-13) This one is twofold.,7,1,0,1,[0 1 0],trump,1,"entity of interest: trump [SEP] Verse 11 unequivocally tells people not to mingle with a man like Trump, and 12-13 completely disintegrates the fundamental base of conservatism- hating people who are different from them.","[0.018834156915545464, 0.025788847357034683, 0.08650128543376923, 0.06478917598724365, 0.10235017538070679, 0.047046974301338196, 0.0834195613861084, 0.11513300240039825, 0.3367031514644623, 0.07199965417385101, 0.04604233428835869, 0.05133114382624626, 0.05956331267952919]",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],['others'],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",['others'],others,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",13,0,0.7512217164039612,"(0, 0.7512217164039612)","entity of interest: trump [SEP] aspect of interest: others [SEP] Verse 11 unequivocally tells people not to mingle with a man like Trump, and 12-13 completely disintegrates the fundamental base of conservatism- hating people who are different from them.",-1,-0.30512771010398865,-1

"I dislike Trump intensely. But its worth pointing out that the same boorish behavior had commentators writing him off against Hilary, but it clearly vibed with viewers.I have faith in Harris, but this does make me somewhat nervous. My hope is that this is just baiting him into keeping the debate nasty instead of on policy issues, because the Dems do better there. To caveat, I don't *like* the fact that the Dems poll poorly on ""policy"" because its clear to me (and should be to any thinking observer) that the Republicans are *bad* for the US economy. But a LOT of people believe otherwise because of high post-Covid inflation and the sheer damage Trump did becoming apparent under Biden.My sense is that we're probably *not* going to have anymore debates after Sept 10 anyway. Trump's already trying to weasel out of that one, and however it goes (whether he wins or loses) he won't agree to anything other than a Fox or NewsMax hosted love fest for a debate after. So maybe this is just the Harris campaign trying to keep Trump off a disciplined message on policy rather than any substantive negotiation on debate formats.","Huh?

"No hate just facts? There is no way you are serious right now. Trump never says he will be a dictator? Wrong again my dude. He says it every rally. He is just really good about tricking you guys into thinking he was just trolling. I'm not a staunch defender of the left and I never wanted Biden to begin with. You are making some wide assumptions. You can't go into a right-wing space without being hip deep in hate. There are fewer facts than constant insults and calls to violence. You are not free of it but you have been brainwashed into believing that your personal brand of hate is justifiable and thus nothing normal people could possibly disagree with. I can go into r/conservative or over on X and find a thousand hate posts in under an hour. If you can honestly be in those spaces often and not see the hate, then you are not an honest and ethical person. All you have to do is sit there and wait for a while. You'll get your fill for sure. If you're being honest. You all need to start learning to take Trump more seriously. He is not trolling, he is monologuing. He tells you all the time but because you hate your political opposition, you just don't care. Because he sticks it to the libs right? There is no reasoning most of the time not because people are bought by the opposition's propaganda but because they are bought on their own. You need to care about what you are supporting in life and I am really sorry my dude but this time, you are in the wrong camp. I want to help but you gotta meet me half way here. Go back to your conservative spaces for a while with a pen and paper and write down every slur, threat, and hatred. If after an hour you can't find any, you need to think about why you agree with those messages. Don't worry about the left right now. Just look inward and ask yourself some tough questions.","He never threatens democracy? Do you ever actually listen or do you get it from the media? The right and left are completely different. The right just reports stuff, there's no hate. Now listen to the left, talking point after talking point, and there is so much anger. We love but I would question if the left does. Trump loves America and making us first. This king talking point is absolutely note true. Trump was is a good troll and the left is so easy because everything is serious. People and make and joke about being a dictator and king, it won't happen. The left is scared because they think Trump will be like them, that's not how we. We aren't angry and why don't want bad to come y'all, we disagree. We've all lied, so has Joe Biden so many and the the left, but is he lying , absolutely not, he never lied about the border, that was Biden, did you see the debate fact check? I like Biden lied 15 times and Trump doesn't really lie like Biden. They will just lay to your face because they know you won't check the facts.Republican bash on illegal immigration, that word y'all can't say? Republican don't play game, that's the left. Not liking Trump for Trump is one thing but voting strictly because you don't like Trump. There is not one thing the left  says that I can't refute, the left can't do the same. There's no substance. The left is voting out every of fear. If we lose control they will come us, that comes from y'all's world view. The right is not like that. Emotions have nothing to with out choice, this is why we aren't angry and east to talk to, I love talking to people that disagree with me. The left handle any other anyone that doesn't agree with them because they dont really know why they believe what they believe and anything that is different is violence towards them. What sound like? Every time the left talks about the right, they describe themselves. And we are all for immigration but do it the right way, just because you stop saying illegal doesn't mean it changes what it is. And then they talk about a bipartisan border bill, did you see that bill? The border was in there but so was a bunch of things. They knew it wouldn't pass but they knew if they said bipartisan and republicans didn't sign it, no need would ask why. If you come here illegally and you get deported, you understand that people should be held accountable. So talking points works when y'all talk with each other but where facts? One of when Trump threatened democracy. There isn't one. It's a house made on, that is why you guys can't talk to anyone that disagrees because after then talking points you need facts and they don't exist. I hope you got outside and talk.

">Who's the foreign power that controls him?      Putin, obviously. You can tell because every aspect of Trump's foreign policy can only be explained by asking 'how does this benefit Russia'. And it's a long fucking list: lifting of sanctions, advocating for Russia to be included in the G8 over the strenuous objections of the rest of the G7, blackmailing Ukraine as part of a scheme to withhold Congressionally mandated military aid, etc, etc.         >You can't overthrow the united states.   That his plan was incompetently conceived as his administration generally was run does not not make it any less of an attempted coup. You can tell, on account of J6 being only one of a half dozen ways Trump tried to steal the result of that election. You need reading material on that?        >What's an ethical Chernobyl?      As just one example, he kept his interests in hotels during his presidency, which allowed him to disguise defacto bribes from foreign leaders as hotel bills. That's a complete disregard of the Emolients clause, which exists specifically to prevent that kind of foreign influence. So that you understand how big an ethical lapse that is, I'll point of that Jimmy Carter sold his peanut farm, and Obama placed his meager earnings as an author into a blind trust, to avoid so much as whiff of impropriety. Trump, on the other hand, turned the very seat of our goverment into a center for profit-taking and grift.    Let's be clear here: Trump has an exhaustive history of sexual assault.  You'll recall that he was caught on tape in an unguarded moment bragging about it.  He brags about creeping on underage pageant contestants. He shows up repeatedly on Epsteins flight logs. You are defending a rapist, by playing semantic games about rape vs sexual assault. JFC, dude.","Who's the foreign power that controls him?You can't overthrow the united states by running around the capital building smashing things. Did you think the USA was that fragile?

"Well again, these are uncharted political waters. When you say ""playing to her strengths"" you are tacitly, stone cold admitting that she is underqualified to debate according to the rules requested by her own party on behalf of the sitting president whom she serves under and hopes to replace.The fact of the matter is, you're wanting to elect this woman president. To be successful leading the country, she needs to be able to hold her own when speaking with foreign leaders — especially when she is disadvantaged. They will not necessarily be kind or patient or on her side.  She must be able to be strong under such conditions or she will fail terribly if elected, and the country will pay the price for it.The whole purpose of the debate is to convince voters who can handle the burden of the presidency. It's precisely why Kamala should debate according to the existing rules.  She can't look strong in a debate where she begged for a handicap; if one is granted to her she'll have already lost the debate before she even takes the stage.  It would be a total self-own.  Conversely, if she debates under terms which she considers unfavorable and looks good doing it, when those same terms ultimately forced Joe Biden to withdraw from the race, that would be the biggest debate boost her campaign could possibly receive.  Her advisors should be telling her the exact same thing.  With a position as serious as POTUS on the line, winning on hard mode is the only way to win.",Gonna have to disagree with you there.

"@@traviswilliams3034 Thanks for your kind words. I was born and still live in Antwerp. But I have relatives in the US (New Hampshire and Connecticut) and I went there twice, aged 9 and 18 (already 33 years ago though). Since then my family came to visit us several times also. The last time was in 2016, before the election and I remember us talking about trump, they were voting against him because they felt he was an embarrassment to the US, even back then. My memories of my visits I'll treasure forever, but since the trump era something 'snapped', sorry to say. I couldn't stand being in a nation where almost half of the people are mesmerized by a lunatic, to the point society is on the brink of collapse. I may be totally wrong here (it's a strong statement), but personally I would have so much doubt about everyone I meet, and a trump supporter is not the kind of person I want to spend time with. Most families probably have a mix of both groups. To me this situation would be unlivable, that's why I say 'collapse of society'. I know it sounds hard, but I just feel such disgust towards them, as they 'destroyed' how I viewed the US. I once saw myself moving there, but not anymore. Anyway, good luck voting him out of politics and in jail once and for all!! The world is counting on you guys!","I'm from Belgium, and we too were pissed at our government 4 years ago.

"Right now Kamala Harris is the most qualified person who could run for president as the Democratic party candidate. We live in the post-TV era. A candidate for president can't just be a dry intellectual technician. Joe Biden already was that and we had a country full of people who couldn't be bothered to get out of bed for him. A presidential candidate has to be able to lead and sell and inspire and exude competence. A whole bunch of people are genuinely excited about her, and they're going to go vote for her. That is a qualification. Besides, she's now held high federal office for a whole presidential term. That's experience.We can have a debate about whether she should have been selected as the vice-presidential candidate in 2020, but that's water under the bridge now. She hasn't done anything to obviously disqualify herself from the office, and that's enough.","White dude here, couldn't care less about gender or ethnicity.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we're, societally, finally to a point where it's possible for there to be more diversity in the higher offices of our government, but I want it to happen *naturally* and incidentally, during the process of selecting the best, most qualified person for the job, not just because we might want it to happen for the sake of progress.Often, in any context, it seems like focusing on someone's gender or race just takes focus away from appreciating who they are and what they've actually accomplished as an individual.

"Jeffrey Epstein self evidently lacked empathy or he would not have preyed on children. But look at the layer above that and you start to see the systemic evolution of psychopathy in government. Epstein being held in NY metro detention means it was likely either Giuliani (the previous mayor of New York or Bill Barr, the head of the DOJ and therefore the Bureau Of Prisons, that opened the necessary doors to have him murdered. It's a small list of people with the access to be able to make prison cameras turn off and doors open.  Bill Barr is at the top of it. [URL] was used to bending the rules to get the job done. When trump demanded Republican governors send national guard troops to the U.S. capital and ""kiss the ring"" of loyalty, Utah's governor Herbert among other GOP loyalists did just that. When trump demanded Mark Milley send US troops to shoot people in Lafayette square, Milley told him it was both wildly illegally and unconstitutional. [URL] trump threw a tantrum, Barr as head of DOJ pulled the workaround and called a bureau of prisons SORT team in to do it.That is the reason none of the ""officers"" had name tags on. Bill Barr and Trump then had Mark Milley come around the other side of the White House so Milley couldn't see the gross violation of the constitution that was happening out back. They wanted Marks uniform to lend credibility to their cock strut walk through the park of beaten protestors like any good authoritarian king.Trump never served. He wasn't fit for the uniform.He just wasn't fit.At all[URL] soon as Mark Milley figured out what was happening he bailed like a hippie at a drug bust.  To anyone who has ever served in the military, Milley's C.Y.A. letter that came afterwards was a masters class in Fuck Around, Find Out.But Milley being a man of honor was still constrained by a set of constitutional rules that trump, Barr and musk don't  care about. Milley adhered to chain of command while gracefully making sure that he checkmated them all in the process.  It just hasn't come out yet. The turducken strategy will probably go down in history as one of the greatest simple acts of just do the right thing patriotism in history.

The sheer volume of Russian oligarchs who happen to have an address at trump towers by 94 makes it self evident that Russian oligarchs who happen to have an address at trump towers by 94 were all looking for a place to launder the money Russian oligarchs who happen to have an address at trump towers by 94 smuggled out of the USSR.  Russian oligarchs who happen to have an address at trump towers by 94 stole from the people in the USSR so systematically that making the cash look convincingly legitimate literally became the physical burden of perestroika. A moscow street thug wears a track suit. When he rebrands himself as an oligarch he wears Armani until everyone at the country club makes fun of him for being basic. Being an ultra rich predator is a....process.But your clock never stops ticking. Communism was an inherently flawed system simply because in the absence of self regulation of greed, it systematically facilitated a class of those without the ability to empathize to rule over the 97%  of people who would split their last meal with you because their soul  intrinsically understands what it feels like to be hungry and would wish that on no one. And it locked them behind an iron curtain.  Over enough  generations greed, unchecked, becomes the dominant evolutionary trait or behavior and kindness and empathy is effectively bred out. About 1.2% of adult men and 0.3% to 0.7% of adult women are considered to have clinically significant levels of psychopathic traits. Those numbers rise exponentially in prison where 15% to 25% of inmates show these characteristics.  But that number is revelatory when you sort by zip code and irregardless of any race, religion or cultural constraints. Psychopathy is an equal opportunity predator.  It relies on sowing division in its prey.

" Still waiting after 27 days all you bias fake news folks at CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, New York Times, Washington Post when are you going to ask Kamala Harris and Tampon Tim Walz some serious questions?  Find out what they're going do to stop the record sky high US inflation, high gasoline prices, high prices for auto insurance, home insurance, high mortgage rates, as well as all illegals flowing in the country, along with the drugs and criminals. And what about putting more police on the streets to cut back on all the crime and major US cities. Yes life was better under four years of Trump and if you're honest, you would agree.What I do know about Harris & Walz is not good and here is a few things I found out.Incompetent  Kamala Harris picks woke Minnesota liberal radical governor Tim Walz as her running mate. Walz is  the liberal governor that allowed ""The Black Lives Matter"" rioting protesters to destroy the city of Minneapolis doing over $1 billion in damages burning, looting, injuring hundreds of police officers, firefighters and civilians also destroying one police station.  I will never vote for this liberal  democrat lawless Governor Walz or incompetent lying Kamala Harris after the past 3 1/2 years of her failed tenure as VP. As governor, dictator democrat Tim Walz signed a bill that gave the state the power to strip moms and dads of their parental rights if they refused to consent to so-called ""gender-affirming care"" for their kids. That is pure evil act.In a Harris-Walz administration, you can expect the following in my opinion.1. More massive influx of illegal immigrants across the southern border.2. More weaponization of the federal government against Catholics and pro-lifers.3. Lawsuits against Catholic hospitals, schools, and charities.4. Parents labeled ""domestic terrorists"" for protecting their kids5. The end of Trump's pro-family tax cuts and child tax credits6. The most radical pro-abortion policies ever forced on America7. Complete disregard for religious freedom and conscience rights.8. Tampon Tim Walz approved tampon dispensers in boys bathrooms in Minnesota Public Schools.9. Tim Walz was arrested for drunk driving and speeding at over 90 mph under the influence.10. Tim Walz lied  about his military rank and insinuated he served in a war zone.Pray  for our country if Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are elected.

People in her base have asked for it. People typically do interviews. It's a very calculated thing the Harris campaign have done. It's why they are calling Trump weird. It's a vibes based election.

"Hey, just wanted to point this out as dangerous thinking. Yes, it's good that we can come together to oppose Trump, but we can't stop pushing our own party to actually follow through on their promises. This isn't a spectator sport of red vs blue and there are more dangers than just the extremism of Trump. Police militarization and unaccountability, corporate takeover of public services, and support for foreign colonial adventurism have been supported by both Republicans and Democrats and all of these trends need to be reversed. Yes, I'm voting for Harris, no I'm not succumbing to an uncritical cult of personality like the MAGgots do. We can't just keep voting for Blue team every cycle, if they refuse to actually stop fascism with the tools and mandate that the voters grant them. They too must be held accountable and number one is getting rid of that stooge Garland and actually prosecuting the insurrectionists and the American Ayatollahs ruling by theocratic decree from the Supreme court. Biden made promises, but it's up to us to hold them to it.Voting is the least essential element of a democratic society, especially when a majority of the countries votes are non-impactful due to the Electoral College. You must organize, agitate, and pressure politicians to keep doing the right thing and not just allow them to profit from corruption like Bob Menendez.",Be suspicious of any comment trying to weaken the newfound unity of the Democrats.

"SHE ANSWERED very clearly. She's talking about starting within to help the economy , such as helping those With the first child within the first year giving a $6000 tax break., building reasonably priced homes for a lot of people because of housing prices that is unnecessarily through the roof, reducing price gouging at the grocery stores. Giving major tax breaks for starting businesses.Meaning that if you have a starting business it's easier for you to push forward while you're trying to gain profit, helping keep the unions intact, And I think she said $25k tax deduction on your first home for the down payment. If you missed all of that, then you must want more so say what that more is. A lot of people will pray to have these type of benefits. And also keeping mine She has to have a balance Because of the trillions of dollars in debt that our country is already in. Remember every country has a budget so she has to move around money for some things to get other things done, Also keep in mind she doesn't control the money the senate does, she has to get approval. She didn't create the debt. She inherited it. She didn't contribute to the 8 trillion dollars Added onto the debt as Trump did. Her administration contributed to reducing it by 2 trillion dollars. She is being realistic giving you things That is probably easier to do rather than selling you A dream with big lies. Her plan is realistic.

"I actually agree more with Cheney on the war and peace question, but she lost my support on the issue of basic rule of law.  Her participation in Adam Schiff's witch hunt was basically treason against the whole concept of American justice.Oddly enough, I got fundraising letters from Cheney during her 2022 primary campaign, and it was obvious that she didn't have a clue how toxic she had become among Republicans.  I usually don't donate to specific candidates unless I am in their state and district, but I considered making an exception here, and returning the Cheney fundraising letter with a copy of a check I would write to her opponent's campaign.I am glad that Trump and Vance were not president on 9/11, but I also cannot argue with how Trump handled any of the foreign policy challenges he faced when he actually was president, and I will be emphatically voting to make him president again.

"Good thing it's not a real problem and we don't need to enact a fake solution to it.Well, I like the idea that Finland has adopted to make it among the best educated countries in the world. Instead of cutting costs to failing schools like in America, they increase investment and go in there and make evaluations and fix the problem.So that's how I look at that.The government loves to use media to scapegoat the Border. They do it every 4 years and you NEVER hear about it otherwise. They do it to fear-monger and distract from real problems.Don't be a gullible snowflake. Look at the real problems: wealth inequality, the shrinking middle class, lack of accountability to corporations fucking everybody in the ass, leaving rural communities to fend themselves more and more (and I'm a city guy who hates rural people and I'm saying this! It's a real problem!), healthcare reform is badly needed, etc.Anyways, Harris has made her thoughts on these issues clear.

No I volunteer in my community and do mutual aid and stuff that actually helps folx. I don't get so worked up about national politics because there isn't much the average person can do. I'm in Indiana and my vote this cycle will be wasted on Kamala. DJT has destroyed several areas of the country so they vote against their interests exclusively. A Kamala vote from me would be worthless. Holding her campaigns feet to the fire NOW is the only time it matters. The democratic platform is being worked out in a smoky room as we speak. Nowadays the folx in that smoky room get Twitter updates about how bad their messaging is. I need them to know how bad their messaging is on Gaza. Young ppl are excited now based on who she is... But it won't last unless she gives young ppl and progressives policy wins in the coming weeks. But Kamala the cop will just pretend to he progressive. I'm afraid she'll govern more from the middle than Biden did and that is so scary and regressive. The problem is the olds who run campaigns want to run them like it's 1967. I bet you are one of those olds. Young ppl aren't going to vote this cycle unless she gives them something. This polling bump because of who she is and her background cannot and should not stand. She needs to earn the youth vote.,"And what does the choice to be an anchor instead of a sail do for anyone here?Sounds like you have an agenda to address with the next left leaning leadership you should help elect into power, right? Great! Do that. Gotta elect them first though. So let's go do that, then you can resume holding their feet to the fire if it's so important to you.

I don't think anyone needs to be 100% aligned with folks they are fans of. There's a lot of more libertarian comedians I enjoy because of their crowd work. But to me the distance between Taylor's message and Trump's platform is large enough to the point that it feels like cognitive dissonance.

Just personally though I don't think I could be a fan of a  musician who endorsed Trump.,"Yes, actually. I am mature enough to be fiends with liberals. I don't hate people based on political beliefs.

"@@philgroves7694 I watched the interview more than once, and no... Kamala did not explain anything. She talks about the 'significance' of things instead of actually answer the question. At no point did she explain why her and Biden can't secure the border right now. Instead, she goes on about a bill that she supports (like that's the only way she can secure the border) and what she did as prosecutor before she was VP. So no, she didn't explain that, or what her foreign policy is (apart from what's already happening right now). Her saying ""We've got to get a deal done"" is not refreshing or intelligent, it's just lip service. Even when she was asked again about her foreign policy and whether she would change anything, she just repeated that we've got to get a deal done. Zero thought went into that response.So, instead of pointing out the instance when Kamala has explained HOW she's going to implement policies, you take a page out of Kamala's playbook and go on and on about nothing because you're unable to answer the question. Say what you will about Trump, but at least that guy has done press conferences by himself. Kamala has not done that, and it's been 40 days now. I'm glad I provided the platform to show how Kamala supporters can't answer a simple question.

"The problem is that, unlike you people in the TDS affected BlueAnon cult, 90% of ordinary people very well understand what Trump said and meant with that statement, i.e. he promised to govern so well and so good (typical Trump bravado BS), that all problems will be fiex in four years. Typical nonsense of course, but not more than that. And regular people understand that, they know that's what he said.

"My first thought was something like.. >I wonder if anyone in Trump's life had ever loved him as much as Walz's family (especially his son), Friends, students, etc. if he would still be one of the worst people alive. I'm willing to guess he wouldn't be but because he's never known unconditional love, actually the opposite, exactly what you described, completely transactional and not love. That makes him a fundamentally broken person and that has been obvious to everybody for as long as they have known him.And the second part of it is straight up rage because they're jealous. That right wing dunce That was making fun of Walz's son has obviously never known unconditional love, especially not from a father figure. Scarecrow Ann throwing shade is jealous because she's never loved anyone or anything like how that family loves each other.Shit, I'm a tiny bit jealous because I don't have any kids, I have a lot of close family and we all love each other very much But I feel like the love between a parent and their children is a special thing (I do have my cat and she's the fucking best so that's as close as I come lol).",Awesome pic and fantastic speech. I told my partner last night that the right wing weirdos would attack him because of the affection and love he and his family share.

"That's why when he spoke at one of the DNC's, when he was just a senator from Illinois and I had no idea who he was, I immediately starting telling people about him and saying I hoped he'd run for president. I was so impressed with not only his brilliant speeches, but also his quiet charisma. In that DNC speech, he spoke of how our country was ""not a red America or a blue America, but a purple Average America."" At the time, I wanted unity. I worked on his campaign here in Iowa and I was overjoyed when he won!I was a little peeved when Obama kept putting Republicans in his administration though! Despite trying to reach across the aisle to Republicans, they bit his hand clean off! Then gnawed on it. He appointed Republicans, and they responded by blocking tons of his judicial nominees, blocking legislation he was in favor of. Basically they tried to make him look ineffective. The worst one was them not allowing Obama to appoint a Supreme Court nominee because it was too close to the election. (Said election was something like 9 months away!) Obama wanted to appoint supposedly moderate Republican Merrick Garland to the court. So we would have gotten a Republican appointed no matter what, which is sad.",I wasn't really old enough to be in politics during Trump era.

After taking up the nomination, she's not once spoke without reading from the teleprompter. She's given no interview. Everything she's currently doing is only scripted. When doing the presidents job it requires you to speak to foreign dignitaries without a teleprompter. She has never demonstrated that she could do this with any degree of affect. But quite opposite is actually happening as we see her come up with these really weird word salads. She makes Marxist mantra statements in her speeches and laughs at inappropriate times. She's just a mess. As the Democrats borders zar she did nothing to stop the huge inflow of illegal people entering our country illegally.",Not believing it at all. However believe what you want. Notice how Kamala has so far not done 1 single interview with anyone. Kamala repeats speeches word for word.

"You'll have to please point out what lies I told. Truly, I reflect on and independently research all parties objectively, including Trumps. The president doesn't have any control over economics is essentially what you're saying, so why then are we, both sides, so adamant that we need our president to fix economic issues within the country? Why is it that as soon as Trump took office, the prices of everything went down, almost immediately? So you saying immediate change isn't possible is null. You saying my personal experience isn't applicable is flat out ignorant. That would also mean that your experience isn't applicable either, yet here we are. Please try to use sensible arguments. The stats say crime is down, but what's included in the stats? Not major cities. Not the cities who's crime has skyrocketed due to people being able to essentially steal things legally. Do you really support legislation that has been passed allowing for theft? Also why are people resorting to theft in the first place? High prices. Low housing affordability. Population influx. To your credit Trump absolutely has some negatives and some are shady at the very best of circumstances, he's a creep yeah (but so was Biden so I don't get this argument). He has done some shady business dealing but again so has most of our sitting government (again Biden as VP when all media lied saying the laptop wasn't real and that Biden didn't pay for a prosecutor to be fired, when in fact it was real and he did). Also yeah he's a felon, but so would most of our government if they would actually allow investigations into themselves by the people. We all know our government is corrupt as hell yeah? His court cases were a show from both sides and most everybody I know, both left and right, agree that the trial was a sham, both from a prosecutors prospective and a defenses perspective. The system was weaponized, there is no objecting that, and that is an issue we should ALL be focused on. Let me clarify that I'm not defending his actions, there is credibility in some cases but it is how the judicial system went about it that is the issue. Trump is harsh with words, there's no doubt about that. But being harsh with words and harsh with actions are two totally different things, and even though he had some really f'd up tweets, his actions for minority communities during his tenure stand as a testament to his beliefs. I'll be replying  a picture from my local Walmart from just two days ago when I went shopping. Things are, indeed, that expensive. Also chicken here was $1.37/lb back in 2019-2020, it is now $2.73/lb. Pork, has stayed relatively the same, I'll give you that. 👍","Most of what you said are lies, some somewhat true. You're so used to Trump'srhetoric that you don't recognize how many things Trump's makes up on the spot, numbers Trump's spouts with no thought to facts or anything else. Trump's has very little control over Inflation, gas prices, or pretty much anything that involves free market forces.  That's what being in a free market means.  We also have survived that pandemic better than almost all other economic powers in the world. I know,  we're not the rest of the world, but comparisons are valid. The effect of bills passed, oil and gas drilling permits issued, and many other things are often not seen until many years later.  To see immediate change is just not possible, even if you think it is. Your personal experience, or perceived personal experience is not applicable. And, crime is down across the nation, that's what the facts say. A simple search will show this, but not every category is down,  that would be unusual. What bothers me is not criticism of Kamala, because any person running for office should be open to critical review, it's the personal and overly exaggerated attacks, like the country won't survive if Kamala's elected, or making fun of Kamala name, or some of the things you've stated that are really out of bounds. The thing I keep seeing is that those who like Trump's just ignore or refuse to admit just about every flaw Trump's has. The bar for Trump's is just so low. Do a critical analysis of many of Trump'sspeeches and you will find lies, weird stories, and rambling stories that are just off the rails. During the debate, when asked about school and educational needs, Trump's spat out a word salad that came down to import taxes being the answer, I guess. The worst part is that Trump's completely ignores environmental issues, literally the biggest issue in the US and the world. Please use some of your time to give Trump's some of the same critical examination that you give Kamala. Just about everything Trump's says should disqualify Trump's from being president or any job of importance. I wish you well and I hope your egg prices come down because here they are $1.99 for crappy eggs and about $3.50 for farm fresh, but nowhere near what you're saying.

"🌐The only press questions Kamala Harris has answered this week is what kind of spices she puts in her chili 🌶️ 🆘 Now Kamala Harris won't answer questions from the press on her radical views or have a press conference except for the staged debate with Dana Bash at fake news CNN that was a total joke. She's going to do the hide in the basement routine like Joe Biden did to get fraudulently elected. And look how that turned out for the country.  ✔️Here are Just 13 Questions for evasive, flip-flopping Kamala Harris to answer.  Americans 🇺🇸 deserve the answers.  1. Ask Kamala Harris what she's going to do to seal our borders and stop the flow of millions of illegals, criminals, and drugs flowing into the country daily.   2. Ask why Kamala Harris who wanted to ban fracking is now in favor of fracking. So what changed her mind.   3. Ask Kamala Harris if she still thinks it's OK to kill helpless babies by evil baby killing abortion right up to the ninth month.  4. Ask Kamala Harris what she plans to do to bring down the record sky high inflation that her and Biden's policies caused American families to suffer under the past 3 years.  5. Ask Kamala Harris if she's going to do mandatory gun buyback and confiscate Americans guns.6. Ask Kamala Harris if she's going to continue to push people to buy electric cars and give up their gasoline cars by 2035.  7. Ask Kamala Harris why she went through 92% of her staff the past 3 years. This doesn't say much for what type of person she is as a leader and boss.   8. Ask Kamala Harris why she ask people to donate to a bail fund to get the Black Lives Matter rioters bailed out of jail to go back and riot more. Because that's what they did.  9. Ask Kamala Harris what she plans to do to help bring down the sky high electric, natural gas and oil heating bills. 10. Ask Kamala Harris what she plans to do to help bring down the cost of home insurance and auto insurance that have skyrocketed the past three years.   11. Ask Kamala Harris what she plans to do to bring down mortgage interest rates so the average first time buyer can afford to buy a home again. 12. Ask Kamala Harris if she's going to tamper with the number of Supreme Court judges on the court, suggest term limits plus all the other rules she's proposing for them. And if so, will she purpose to do the same for herself as well as Congress and Senate with new term limits on those offices too.   13. Ask Kamala Harris, what her plans are to end the war in Ukraine as well as the conflicts going on in the Middle East. Lazy liberal biased reporters do your job.

"Yes, he does. But he also unfortunately falls into the category of people who think the concept of Project 2025 is so wild, it couldn't possibly happen. He's not voting for Trump, but he's one of those voters who would rather just not vote and no amount of telling him that no vote is a vote for Trump will convince him otherwise. And as much as I wish he'd understand that, I've been that voter until this election so I understand the moral dilemma.","Does your husband also lean left in women's rights and lgbtq rights? The Republican Party clearly is interested in taking away rights from women and lgbtq persons. Anyone who is undecided at this point is just being difficult for the sake of it.Do you want the Trumps dumpster fire show that strives to dismantle the United States or do you want to try to get back to status quo with a mixed race female candidate who probably won't fall down or fall asleep on tv?If your husband has respect for you as a woman he would vote for the candidate that has the best policy towards women's rights.This isn't complicated. I also can't believe there are people who are sincerely undecided.

"@@davekearney1944I believe Trump was voted out for several reasons that people were upset about and limiting travel from China was something I agreed with at that time. Tariffs made people mad as well but we have to understand that we need to actually make things including our own antibiotics. We cannot allow ourselves to be at the mercy of anyone. I know Trump would not have been dumb enough to give Afghanistan the heads up when we were pulling out of there either. He was definitely right about securing the border with laws that already exist and we wouldn't be dealing with the aftermath of that situation as we are now. Hindsight is 20/20. Biden was viewed as a moderate with Catholic religious convictions. On the issue of abortion he would have never taken an extreme leftist view and I think that made more people comfortable with voting for him as well. We shall see how the overturning of Roe vs. Wade plays out. It could bring more leftists out to vote and I've always believed that some cheating goes on with both if not all political parties so the argument that it's all fair and square is ridiculous. Am pretty sure that if Gore had won we wouldn't have entered war so easily in Iraq. I am an elderly white female and not or never have been affiliated with either party and have never elected a president before. I may not cast a vote for the side that wins but I'm voting Trump in this election. I was not happy much in the last election between Biden and Trump and was leaning toward Biden at one point but then I realized that Trump wanted to do things differently and knew he would win Texas so I stayed home. We have been living under corporate politics because of the banking system and Wall Street and the Federal Reserve's immense power over our economic system that every president has kept the status quo and it's just ridiculous to think that most in the oval office or in the Senate are really looking out for the country's best interest.Kamala's approach at the moment is a bunch of band aid solutions that will not work long term and only serves to gain a constituency to remain in power. ( They) do that so they can get rich and move on.I believe that Donald wants to work for a meaningful middle class. I believe Kamala sees that is the biggest voting base and doesn't really care about middle class issues. If she did she wouldn't be as clueless as she is and constantly switch to the very same ideas that Trump has always stood for. I also say this because she has such extreme leftist views in general. I also do not trust her on how she got into social circles by being a mistress. This does not represent true female empowerment in my eyes. Passing her bar exam the first time would have made  me more confident of her intellect but it's not Donald's intellect that impresses me. It's his ability to have common sense and negotiate. Even though he has put trust in people that let him down at least he didn't lie because he was told to about a president that can barely do his duties. Are we really supposed to believe he negotiated the prisoner swap with Russia? That was obviously a contrived move by others to give people confidence that Biden is a viable President but now Kamala is coming clean and saying she was covering for him but she'll never admit that he probably didn't negotiate that prisoner swap. Russia went along with it because they got the better deal anyway. If I tell Democrats I don't trust her because she helped Jill and others commit elderly abuse then they'll tell me I'm off my rocker but would not hesitate to say this about Trump's camp if the shoe were on the other foot and it's their insane hypocrisy that convinces me that they are really in this for themselves. I couldn't do to Biden what these people have done. It's one of the most sad situations I've ever witnessed in politics and they were handling it in a way where normal people were supposed to go into denial because "" they said so.""

If democracy falls in America it will not be long before it falls everywhere. Giving more money to Billionaires, and more power to corporations is the beginning of tyranny.  A government that fears the people is democracy, when people fear the government it is tyranny. Whether or not you agree with abortion, you have to ask yourself...what is next?Will the government or Insurance companies decide next who lives and dies. It is real. One more step into the Doctor's office from the Government and you might have less and less control of even your health. As a Christian I believe there are some issues that are only between you and God.

Wait are you complaining because Trump made trade better (fair) for the US and because you might have to deal with the illegal immigration problem the US is dealing with?? 🤣🤣🤣That's not exactly getting dragged through the dirt,"""During Trump first term, Trump often claimed that trade with Canada was hurting American workers. Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to protect these industries in the US, denounced Canada's trade barriers as hurting Wisconsin farmers, and demanded the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico.""""These negotiations led to the signing of the new United States Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), in which Canada had to make concessions, notably by granting American farmers better access to the Canadian market. Trump may well take advantage of the moment when the US, Canada and Mexico will have the opportunity to request revisions to the agreement (date set for July 1, 2026), to try to obtain new trade concessions from Canada to the benefit of American workers""Source: 4 Joshua P.

Harris was in the 2020 primaries and was knocked out after the first debate with Tulsi and she wasn't in the future debates and did not win a single primary or not even 1% of anything election related. Nobody wanted her then and nobody wants her now. She was very unpopular in 2020 for **locking up black men as a prosecutor** and now **all of a sudden** she is super popular like the new Obama 2024? Gimme a break. It is all fake bullshit to pretend that she has super popularity. They will go to great lengths to make it seem like she is popular even though she is not.If she was the new Obama she would have emerged and dominated in the 2020 primaries but she was unlikable then and is the same unlikable person now. Voters in the 2020 primaries rejected her. It is all fake. She spent the last 4 years accomplishing nothing. Do you know who actually is popular? Bernie Sanders is popular with **real actual support** **then and now.** But guess what? They don't let Bernie Sanders get the nomination so they give it to someone else like Harris and create the fake support around that choice.

"Your poor reading comprehension probably explains your support for Trump tbh.>Every single major newspaper endorsed Hillary as did the vast majority of tech oligarchs and 99% of their employees.I didn't say they endorsed Trump, I said they COVERED him. They spam articles about him which keeps him at the forefront of any discussion. Half of Biden's policies went underreported because Trump said some new insane thing the media decided to cover instead.>If she's only answered a ""quick question or two"" then how are ""most of the questions"" about Trump? You're living in a fantasy world.If you're asked 10 questions, 8 of which are about Trump and you answer the two that aren't, you've answered a question or two while most of the questions were about Trump. See, this is where your poor reading comprehension failed you.>Yes, she has just announced a few completely insane policies after more than an entire month with no policies at all. If you want to know what Trump's policies are, why not go to his website and find out?I did go to his website and his ""policies"" are competely insane lmao. ""Seal border"", ""end inflation"", ""Strengthen and modernize our military, making it, without question, the strongest and most powerful in the world"", it's all a bunch of bullshit and none of that actually says how he intends to do that. If Kamala said her policy was ""Achieve world piece, cure cancer and make sure every american gets a free house and a car"" it would be a policy but it would also be a completely insane nonsense.>Haha, so you really do want to ""fact check"" your political enemies more than the candidates in your party? Fact checking one candidate 100x more than another is an example of the media not only being fair, but actively PRO TRUMP? Are you even reading what you're writing down here?Again, your poor reading comprehension failed you. I said I want BOTH parties to be fact checked when they're lying. If Trump lies more, he gets fact checked more, obviously.>Huh? So they weren't adversarial? They were, PRO TRUMP? Or you know, rabidly and openly anti trump?Here your lack of critical thinking is the issue. Not everything is pro Trump or anti Trump, there is also neutral. He was treated like any other candidate until he started insulting them and being racist.>I see. So your team has all the facts so they never need to be ""fact checked"" and all the journalists so they never need to be interviewed by anyone who is not on their team. BTW who gets to decide who is a journalist and who isn't? Is it the ""fact checkers""?What are you even talking about here?Fox News literally said Carlson wasn't a journalist in a court case while he was still working for them. >The ""'general tenor' of the show should then inform a viewer that [Carlson] is not 'stating actual facts' about the topics he discusses and is instead engaging in 'exaggeration' and 'non-literal commentary.' "">She wrote: ""Fox persuasively argues, that given Mr. Carlson's reputation, any reasonable viewer 'arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticism' about the statement he makes.""There's the direct quote from the lawyer for you. That doesn't really make him sound like a journalist, does it?>So he's answered 81 questions in the same time period Kamala answered 3, but you didnt like the answers so they don't count.He didn't answer them, he talked after being asked a question. If I ask you where you were born and you start talking about Hannibal Lecter and Silence of the Lambs in response, you didn't answer my question. I don't see why this is so difficult to understand, a primary school child should understand it.>And those answers need to be fact checked, LIVE, but your candidate's don't.Literally the opposite of what I said, I said both sides need to be fact checked but go off mate.>Yes. ONE media company out of dozens in pro trump. Again, it's hard to even imagine being this disconnected from reality.Fox News, Newsmax, One America News Network, The Epoch Times... Also Truth (lmao) Social and Twitter when it comes to social media, etc..Your whole response was just rambling nonsense that didn't really address anything I said. You just made up bullshit you could argue against and pretended I said it. If your next response isn't coherent, proper response where you actually address my post, I won't bother replying. I got better things to do with my life than trying to teach you reading comprehension and critical thinking. Have a nice day mate.",">Mostly from the past 10 years of media behavior. Trump drives up clicks so they keep writing about Trump. Also the fact that one of the biggest TV networks has been aggressively deepthroating Trump for the same amount of time. It's hard to even imagine being this disconnected from reality. [[URL] single major newspaper endorsed Kamala as did the vast majority of tech oligarchs and 99% of their employees. >Kamala actually has answered a quick question or two but ""most of the questions"" about Trumpare about Trump. Blame the media for being obsessed with Trump.If Kamala's only answered a ""quick question or two"" then how are ""most of the questions"" about Trump? You're living in a fantasy world. >Kamala has Trump's policiesand has been openly talking about Trump's policies. What are Trumppolicies?Yes, Kamala has just announced a few completely insane policies after more than an entire month with no policies at all. If you want to know what Trump's policiesare, why not go to Trump website and find out?>And Kamala's done that. Just because you close your eyes and pretend really hard Kamala hasn't doesn't change that.LOL. How many questions has Kamala taken from the press since Kamala was picked to replace Biden OVER A MONTH AGO? >Because Trump lies 100x more than Biden or any democrat. It's simple, don't lie and you don't get fact checked.Haha, so you really do want to ""fact check"" your political enemies more than the candidates in your party? Fact checking one candidate 100x more than another is an example of the media not only being fair, but actively PRO Trump? Are you even reading what you're writing down here?>They weren't adversarial journalists, the media, who you claim is pro donald trump were just the only ones that didn't treat Trump with kiddie gloves and it was clearly a very harrowing experience for Trump.Huh? So the media, who you claim is pro donald trump weren't adversarial? the media, who you claim is pro donald trump were, PRO Trump? Or you know, rabidly and openly anti Trump? >Tucker Carlson isn't a journalist. He's a radical lunatic and shouldn't be legitimized in any way, shape or form.I see. So your team has all the facts so they never need to be ""fact checked"" and all the journalists so they never need to be interviewed by anyone who is not on their team. BTW who gets to decide who is a journalist and who isn't? Is it the ""fact checkers""? >I'll say it again in hopes you understand it this time. Just because he said something after being asked a question doesn't mean he actually answered the question. If Biden or Kamala started answering the questions the same way Trump does, you people would be calling for them to be placed in a mental institution.I see. So Trump's answered 81 questions in the same time period Kamala answered 3, but you didnt like the answers so they don't count. Answering 3 questions is just as good and is a perfect example of a candidate being accessible and accountable to the press. Only answers that satisfy YOU are allowed. And those answers need to be fact checked, LIVE, but your candidate's don't. Because they never lie! The ""fact checkers"" say so!>So to be clear, you are simultaneously arguing that the media is anti Trump and that one of the biggest media companies is pro Trump? Which is it?Yes. ONE media company out of dozens in pro Trump. Again, it's hard to even imagine being this disconnected from reality.

"What is Trump going to do? If he puts tariffs on Chinese imports, good luck getting anything cheaper. If he provides more tax cuts, good luck when everyone spends their ""extra"" income and creates more demand driving prices back up. (I'm solidly lower middle class and my taxes actually went up after his last ""cut""). Inflation from 2021-2024 has been a result of lower supply after the pandemic + everyone spending to ""catch up"" on lost opportunities during covid. Eating at restaurants + traveling etc. Trump says he's going to refill the strategic oil reserves on day 1. Okay. What happens to the price of gas when the government starts competing with us to buy up barrels of oil? It drives prices higher. Also, in some industries it's purely capitalizing on inflation by companies to deflect blame for price hikes. The DOW was at 30,000 when Biden took office and now is at 40,000. What gives? Everyone hurting to buy groceries but stocks at an all time high? 🤔 and now Trump wants to drop corporate taxes from 21% to 15%? Those guys don't need it. It's fine to criticize single payer healthcare. Your points there are very legitimate. If we just mix private providers with government insurance it will be a disaster. And I'm not a blind Harris supporter. The President can only do so much despite everyone's campaign promises. But Harris and Walz have some decent plans for things like helping folks with the cost of childcare and paid family leave that could really help families out. And the child tax credit. Haven't been able to get those done this term since Congress shifted and Joe Manchin has been unwilling to support them. I know things are rough right now, but Trump is likely (based on what kinds of promises he's made) to make things worse not better, imo.","So how many jobs will privatizing health care end? I was on government funded health care for a few years and it was terrible. The dental and vision was the worst. Need a filling? We will extract it because your insurance doesent cover that sir. Need glasses? Sir you can pick from the bottom row there any of those birth control glasses from 1974 you can pick because your insurance dont cover anything else. (Birth control because with them on you arent getting laid) im sorry but i'll gladly pay 31$ per week for better care, will enjoy not paying 4$ a gallon for gas, and it will be nice to buy more than one bag of groceries for 150$.

"@@mobydick4324 He predicted that Trump would win the popular vote in 2016 which was wrong. Also, if you understand how the electoral college works, you would know that a model like the 13 keys could only predict the popular vote because the electoral college doesn't always line up with national trends due to the nature of it. Even Lichtman knows this which is why he had Samuel Tilden winning in 1876 and Grover Cleveland winning in 1888 in his retrospective analysis even though both of them lost the electoral college.","For all those praising this system right now, let me give you a few reasons why you should be skeptical of this prediction.1. The system only predicts the popular vote and NOT the electoral college. This is what Lichtman has said in many interviews and writings. He only ever started saying that it predicted the electoral college after the 2016 election because he wanted to be able to say that he correctly predicted the outcome when he didn't.2.  Even when it comes to predicting the popular vote, the keys are fickle. The elections of 1880, 1924, 1972, and 2004 all had 4 keys against the incumbent party, but the incumbent party's candidate won the popular vote by 0.1 points, 23.15 points, 25.2 points, and 2.5 points respectively. There are more examples of this, but this should be enough for you to get the point.3. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1 points in 2016, but lost the electoral college. We already have an example of an election which had the same number of keys that will most likely be against the incumbent party in this election (4) that had a smaller popular vote margin of victory than Clinton in 2016, an election in which the popular vote winner lost the electoral college. Furthermore, Biden won the popular vote by 4.5 points and BARELY won the electoral college, yet we have 2 examples of elections that had 4 keys against the incumbent party in which the popular vote margin of victory was significantly smaller than Biden's.4. Lichtman actually developed the keys knowing that it would not always correctly predict the winner of the election as the keys had Samuel Tilden winning in 1876 and Grover Cleveland winning in 1888. However, they both lost their respective elections. This is because again, the keys predict the popular vote and not the electoral college.The keys do have some predictive power, but if you examine the keys and their track record closely, you'll see that they're definitely fallible. I'm not saying that I think that Trump is going to win this election, IMO the race is a tossup, but I'm saying that you should be skeptical of this prediction and not doom or celebrate just yet.",UgxM-NyIYcLGwrSXcwl4AaABAg.A81Su5UoCCxA81hZZ6tf7f,UgxM-NyIYcLGwrSXcwl4AaABAg,2024-09-06,2,xE22XjWEyQE,"He Predicted Trump in 2016, Biden in 2020 and Now… | NYT Opinion",2024-09-05,9,Youtube,@@mobydick4324 He predicted that Trump would win the popular vote in 2016 which was wrong.,,0,1,0,1,[0 1 0],trump,1,entity of interest: trump [SEP] @@mobydick4324 He predicted that Trump would win the popular vote in 2016 which was wrong.,"[0.014705409295856953, 0.02649102732539177, 0.21859927475452423, 0.020174290984869003, 0.03295817971229553, 0.016266468912363052, 0.01937149465084076, 0.041184406727552414, 0.03154386579990387, 0.05141514912247658, 0.02677295356988907, 0.016090920194983482, 0.20605836808681488]",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],['others'],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",['voter sentiment'],voter sentiment,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",12,0,0.2665646970272064,"(0, 0.2665646970272064)",entity of interest: trump [SEP] aspect of interest: voter sentiment [SEP] @@mobydick4324 He predicted that Trump would win the popular vote in 2016 which was wrong.,-1,-0.2998494505882263,-1

I'm genuinely wondering why all of a sudden people think this is a win for Kamala in the 2020 primaries Tulsi Gabbard shut up her whole campaign and had her silent after questioning mishaps in her career as prosecutor. What makes us think its better for Trump to question her at every turn and during her talking about her platform. Honestly seems risky by her campaign to suggest this when Trump is known for his outspokeness towards his political counterparts. Not to mention I genuinely believe that Kamala on a debate stage is not something we have seen her be successful at. Why give Trump the opportunity to make this debate something we all go back to work or school talking about how the debate gave me no extra information and was a waste of my time. Personally I still am entertaining both as I side with different issues on each side of the isle and would actually like to hear genuine constructive arguments instead of a yelling and screaming match. Both give me concerns that I am working through to make an educated vote why can not put them both on a leash and see a debate where the problems that plague the country are actually talked and conversated about instead of constant mudslinging muting mics is not a benefit just as leaving mics unmuted is not a benefit.

"Would also predict Harris. Policy-wise donny has better promises than the democrats have realtities. However promises are alway better than reality. What donny did his first term was selectively enrich the upper middle class by tax cuts that ultimately came from the lower income working class and the high income working class. The high income working class not only generates by far the most income for the US but is also the most mobile. These people have been leaving the country. The low income working class can't leave so they just enjoyed the drastic collapse of their living standards. The other group that really made it rich during trump were are the property owning landlords, also at the expense of the working class. Things actually got slightly better after 3+ years of trump out of office. Donny figures the lower income people are too stupid to figure out what he actually did with recarving the tax system and the rich people can carry him into office. But their is a second factor and that is actual character of the candidates and this is where trump  dies.Trump has a long term record of horrendous attitudes towards women which range from calling Epstein a ""great guy"" who just likes his women ""a little young"" to making open remarks in a talk show about being allowed to grab a womens -----. He also has a record of turning on numerous people around him. The final straw though is the problem with the supposed assignation attempt. Trump didn't describe a bullet hitting his ear he described cutting his ear with some type of implement. ""He could feel the flesh tearing"". The odds of a bullet really aimed at trump's head missing him but still scratching a part of the body that would be ambiguous with a self-inflicted wound are tiny.

"Please don't joke like that. Yes, Kim K would have a good chance. Lol. As a whole, Trump is not liked here. He will never get the majority of votes but he can win because of our electoral college. I'd say 20% of Americans like him. Of those, half are fanatically supportive of him and privately wish we were back in the 1850s or 1950s when laws existed that overtly discriminated against minorities and citizens of African descent. These are the ones who want to roll back to a world where civil rights weren't a thing and a second class citizen could be underpaid for labor. They don't like women or minorities in positions of power and find that their ""kind of people"" are losing the culture war. Another 20% of Americans simply find him as their useful idiot (but think that he is a bad human). People from this group vote with their wallets. They want to pay less in taxes, rack up multigenerational wealth, and then retire happily (and sometimes to another country).","We had a TV show here in Denmark called ""Trump's tweets"", its only purpose was to make fun of Trump, or rather to catalogue some of the really weird things Trump said and did during Trump presidency. Some of the things the show covered were bordering on satire, like when Trump held a press conference at four seasons landscaping.I saw some American conservatives discussing online how Trump was respected among our allies, and I kind of had to point out that Trump was being mocked by the entire world. They kind of dismissed my claim, as if refusing to believe it.Ever since 2016, the US has shown that it isn't dependable as an ally. If Trump could be elected, who is the next logical choice?

"To answer your question, I consider it propaganda when the post is clearly made and supported by bots. If you go through op's account you would see that 99% of posts get 1000s of upvotes within a short bit. I refuse to believe that someone can get 6 mil karma without being famous or a bot. Click on op's page for political posts that make it to the front page on a subreddit not involved with politics. A far majority of the time that person will have karma >300,000. I do not like trump. That being said, I find it weird that the popular page is filled with anti trump posts on non political subreddits. Every. Single. Day. I could be wrong, but I find it hard to believe that such a high % of people spend this much of their time talking about Trump on a daily basis. I also think that Reddit is a propaganda site because they have next to 0 ways of filtering their content. On twitter, I don't get political topics because I've muted 20 words from trump to election. Even if I mute subreddits here, they still show up on my popular page in a few days. When you combine the fact that Reddit lets political bots run large with only left leaning ideologies when you can't even filter the content, that's when I consider it propaganda. I don't consider it propaganda if I can tell an actual user posted the content, or if the content is posted in a political sub.","Genuine question: when you say ""propaganda,"" how much are you referring to intention? Like ok if whatever posted this current post is a literal bot somewhere on a server? (I have a loose concept of the internet, I admit, but) I can at least admit that would be literal, intentional propaganda. Like, that's by it's very nature not organic. That's someone creating things with the explicit purpose of creating content *for* it, in a conscious effort for political gain and to influence our thoughts on who to vote for etc etc that makes sense, and that I think we can agree on.But if whatever posted this current post was just a regular-ass guy or woman who saw this and thought, ""man, that was a solid line ngl,"" and then took to their phone or PC *themselves* and made a video *with their own thumbs typing on their smartphone,* would that still count as propaganda in your mind? Like, if something happens to be of a political topic and someone genuinely in that moment wants people to see it, are they ""spreading propaganda"" even if in their own mind they're not like wringing their hands thinking ""yes...yes...I'm doing my part as a cog in the evil machine that is slowly brainwashing everyone with PrOpAgAnDa."" What if they legit think it's funny and people should see it, and now you're seeing the result of other people seeing it and upvoting it?Because nowadays it feels like even individual people independently posting things that they themselves think are interesting or funny or whatever can now be defined as propaganda just by the very nature of the post having to do with politics, whether directly or, in this case, I'd argue indirectly, and if that's the case I don't think I'd agree that this would qualify as propaganda.

"Interesting that this week (as of 9/6) Trump has pulled ahead in the betting markets and in the Silver model. The Harris campaign also seems to get antsy when internal polling is discussed. The Harris campaign lost ground in Minnesota after picking Walz as VP... so we'll see. I wouldn't underestimate people's fond memories of the 2016-2019 economy and state of foreign affairs.  I think it would be good for people on this thread to contemplate that for many people Harris is complicit in the scandal of attempting to hide Biden mental decline and that while the Biden/Harris administration made major policy changes, they were broadly unpopular in retrospect with respect to increasing illegal immigration and inflation. So some keys could clearly go the other way. The election will be close, and if Trump wins, there will probably be a mismatch between the popular vote and the electoral college, where Republicans hold an advantage. Also, bear in mind that in the 2022 midterms, as poorly as the Republicans performed, they still won the House popular vote by 3M votes. While Georgia, for example, may be polling close, there is no way Trump is losing Georgia, a state the current GOP governor carried  by 300,000 votes vs. the OG election denier Stacey Abrams.",,UgzuwRnSbLNVnMGQUXN4AaABAg,,2024-09-09,1,xE22XjWEyQE,"He Predicted Trump in 2016, Biden in 2020 and Now… | NYT Opinion",2024-09-05,0,Youtube,"While Georgia, for example, may be polling close, there is no way Trump is losing Georgia, a state the current GOP governor carried  by 300,000 votes vs. the OG election denier Stacey Abrams.","Also, bear in mind that in the 2022 midterms, as poorly as the Republicans performed, they still won the House popular vote by 3M votes.",8,1,0,1,[0 1 0],trump,1,"entity of interest: trump [SEP] While Georgia, for example, may be polling close, there is no way Trump is losing Georgia, a state the current GOP governor carried  by 300,000 votes vs. the OG election denier Stacey Abrams.","[0.01894526556134224, 0.016953015699982643, 0.06898900121450424, 0.02762516401708126, 0.041956350207328796, 0.01685885712504387, 0.013199280947446823, 0.2215891033411026, 0.033685557544231415, 0.05798810347914696, 0.0485929399728775, 0.017411384731531143, 0.20679529011249542]",[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.],['others'],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",['voter sentiment'],voter sentiment,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",12,0,0.15177854895591736,"(0, 0.15177854895591736)","entity of interest: trump [SEP] aspect of interest: voter sentiment [SEP] While Georgia, for example, may be polling close, there is no way Trump is losing Georgia, a state the current GOP governor carried  by 300,000 votes vs. the OG election denier Stacey Abrams.",-1,-0.3675905168056488,0
